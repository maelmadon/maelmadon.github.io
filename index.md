<!-- ## About me  -->
<img style="float:right; margin:10px" width="200" src="src/img/wink_recadre_small_size.jpg">


Welcome to my website!
I am Maël Madon, a french researcher in Computer Science, right now on a sabbatical for the year 2024/2025.

I did my PhD with [Georges Da Costa](https://www.irit.fr/~Georges.Da-Costa/) and [Jean-Marc Pierson](https://www.irit.fr/~Jean-Marc.Pierson/), whithin the [SEPIA team](https://www.irit.fr/departement/architecture-systemes-reseaux/equipe-sepia/) at IRIT, University of Toulouse.
My topic was [Digital Sufficiency in Data Centers](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04675558v1) and I defended in April 2024.
I want to go beyond energy efficiency techniques and involve the end-user of data centers to help mitigate the environmental footprint of ICT.

## Research interests

- Green IT / ICT for Sustainability
- Digital Sufficiency
- Modelling and simulation of distributed systems
- Energy- and user-aware scheduling

## Education
- **PhD in Computer Science, 2024.** 
*Université de Toulouse (France)*
- **Diploma of École Polytechnique, 2021.**
*École Polytechnique, Palaiseau (France)*
- **Master of Science in Engineering, 2021.**
*KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm (Sweden)*


## Other

Apart from research, my passions are climbing, singing and playing the guitar.
I try to live sustainably because I am convinced that life can be enjoyed without overshooting the natural limits of our planet!
