<!-- ## About me  -->

Welcome to my website!

I am a French researcher in Computer Science, right now on a gap year for the year 2024/2025.
I have a strong interest in understanding, modeling and addressing the environmental impact of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and in particular of data centers.
My research mixes methods from the field of distributed systems (software development, simulations, statistical analysis) with methods from qualitative research
(interviews, thematic analysis) and environmental sciences (Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)).

I did my PhD with [Georges Da Costa](https://www.irit.fr/~Georges.Da-Costa/) and [Jean-Marc Pierson](https://www.irit.fr/~Jean-Marc.Pierson/), whithin the [SEPIA team](https://www.irit.fr/departement/architecture-systemes-reseaux/equipe-sepia/) at IRIT, University of Toulouse.
My topic was [Digital Sufficiency in Data Centers](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04675558v1) and I defended in April 2024.
I want to go beyond energy efficiency techniques and involve the end-user of data centers to help mitigate the environmental footprint of ICT.

## Other

Apart from research, my passions are climbing, hiking and singing.
I try to live sustainably because I am convinced that life can be enjoyed without overshooting the natural limits of our planet!
